### TASK 1 (StringGenerator)
Please write a function that will take an int n value as a parameter but will
return a String of length n, which will contain the characters: "+" and "-",
starting with a "+" character.
For example, for given n=5, your function should return "+-+-+", and for
given n=8 it should return "+-+-+-+-".

### TASK 2 (BugInCode)
The program  calculates the sum of the elements of the array passed to the method. Unfortunately, the program
does not work properly in some cases, find the bug(s) and modify the code so that the program works properly.

### TASK 3 (ZeroCounter)
Write a program that, for a given int n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), will return an array
containing n non-repeating integers, the sum of which will be 0. The
program can return any such array.
For example, for a given int n = 4, the program could return [1,0,-3,2], and for
an int n = 3 one possible response is [-1, 0.1]– but there are many more
correct answers.

### TASK 4 (SiblingFinder)
Two non-negative integers are called siblings if they can be obtained from each other by
rearranging the digits of their decimal representations. For example, 123 and 213 are
siblings, 535 and 355 are also siblings.
A set consisting of a non-negative integer n and all of its siblings is called the family of n.
For example, the family of 553 comprises three numbers: 355, 535, and 553.
Write program that, for given a non-negative integer n, returns the largest numer in the
family of n.
For example, given n=213 the function should return 321. Given n = 553 the function
should return 553.
Assume that, n is an integer within the range: 0 ≤ n ≤ 10 000

### TASK 5 (FirstCharCheck)
Please complete an implementation of a method repFirstChar, that
should return a string describing first character of the given string.
So for: an uppercase letter „upper”, for lowercase letter „lower”, for digit
„digit” and for other characters „other”. You can assume the characters
are ASCII.
